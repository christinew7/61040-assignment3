# DayPlanner
A simple day planner. This implementation focuses on the core concept of organizing activities for a single day with both manual and AI-assisted scheduling.

## Concept: DayPlanner

**Purpose**: Help you organize activities for a single day <br>
**Principle**: You can add activities one at a time, assign them to times, and then observe the completed schedule <br>

### Core State
- **Activities**: Set of activities with title, duration, and optional startTime <br>
- **Assignments**: Set of activity-to-time assignments <br>
- **Time System**: All times in half-hour slots starting at midnight (0 = 12:00 AM, 13 = 6:30 AM) <br>

### Core Actions
- `addActivity(title: string, duration: number): Activity`
- `removeActivity(activity: Activity)`
- `assignActivity(activity: Activity, startTime: number)`
- `unassignActivity(activity: Activity)`
- `requestAssignmentsFromLLM()` - AI-assisted scheduling with hardwired preferences

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **TypeScript** (will be installed automatically)
- **Google Gemini API Key** (free at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Empty lines
Scenario: There are some patterns that will copy and paste empty text, so some items in the file will be an empty "". 

<!--
## Quick Setup

### 0. Clone the repo locally and navigate to it
```cd intro-gemini-schedule```

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Add Your API Key

**Why use a template?** The `config.json` file contains your private API key and should never be committed to version control. The template approach lets you:
- Keep the template file in git (safe to share)
- Create your own `config.json` locally (keeps your API key private)
- Easily set up the project on any machine

**Step 1:** Copy the template file:
```bash
cp config.json.template config.json
```

**Step 2:** Edit `config.json` and add your API key:
```json
{
  "apiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

**To get your API key:**
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key and paste it into `config.json` (replacing `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`)

### 3. Run the Application

**Run all test cases:**
```bash
npm start
```

<!-- **Run specific test cases:**
```bash
npm run manual    # Manual scheduling only
npm run llm       # LLM-assisted scheduling only
npm run mixed     # Mixed manual + LLM scheduling -->
<!-- ```

## Test Cases

The application includes three comprehensive test cases:

### 1. Manual Scheduling
Demonstrates adding activities and manually assigning them to time slots:

```typescript
const planner = new DayPlanner();
const breakfast = planner.addActivity('Breakfast', 1); // 30 minutes
planner.assignActivity(breakfast, 14); // 7:00 AM
``` -->

<!-- ### 2. LLM-Assisted Scheduling
Shows AI-powered scheduling with hardwired preferences:

```typescript
const planner = new DayPlanner();
planner.addActivity('Morning Jog', 2);
planner.addActivity('Math Homework', 4);
await llm.requestAssignmentsFromLLM(planner);
```

### 3. Mixed Scheduling
Combines manual assignments with AI assistance for remaining activities.

## Sample Output

```
Owner: alice
File with 9 items:
Materials
Yarn: DK weight yarn – Samples feature Paintbox Simply Aran, 100% Cotton Tea Rose (643) Pale Lilac (646) Bubblegum Pink (651)
Tools
Hook: 4mm
Darning Needle
Scissors
Instructions
>> Foundation Chain: Ch 6, ss in 6th ch from hook to form a ring.
Round One: Ch 3(counts as a tr here and throughout), 19 tr in ring, join with ss in top of ch- 3.
``` -->

<!-- ## Key Features

- **Simple State Management**: Activities and assignments stored in memory
- **Flexible Time System**: Half-hour slots from midnight (0-47)
- **Query-Based Display**: Schedule generated on-demand, not stored sorted
- **AI Integration**: Hardwired preferences in LLM prompt (no external hints)
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents overlapping activities
- **Clean Architecture**: First principles implementation with no legacy code -->

<!-- ## LLM Preferences (Hardwired)

The AI uses these built-in preferences:
- Exercise activities: Morning (6:00 AM - 10:00 AM)
- Study/Classes: Focused hours (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM)
- Meals: Regular intervals (breakfast 7-9 AM, lunch 12-1 PM, dinner 6-8 PM)
- Social/Relaxation: Evenings (6:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
- Avoid: Demanding activities after 10:00 PM -->

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

### "Could not load config.json"
- Ensure `config.json` exists with your API key
- Check JSON format is correct

### "Error calling Gemini API"
- Verify API key is correct
- Check internet connection
- Ensure API access is enabled in Google AI Studio

### Build Issues
- Use `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
- Check that all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

## Next Steps

Try extending the DayPlanner:
- Add weekly scheduling
- Implement activity categories
- Add location information
- Create a web interface
- Add conflict resolution strategies
- Implement recurring activities
